# Deckbuilding Theory
## Singletons
In deckbuilding theory, there are 5 rules for singletons:

- Extra copies of cards you already have playset (Mana Leak as a 5th CS)
- Tutor targets
- Extra SB cards (you only have space for 3 duress in the sb, so you add 1 in the main, so its not really a singleton if you look at the deck as the full 75 cards)
- Cards that provide inevitability (that in long games will be eventually drawn and win the game, like Denizen in Fams)
- And cards that if drawn together are really bad because they dont provide aditional effects (Blood Moon being the easy example, the 2nd one drawn is really bad usually)
